## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Not enough topics in database"
**Solution:** Run seed manually: `npm run seed` in backend directory

### Issue: Daily topics showing < 3 cards
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify database has at least 3 topics
3. Clear user's completed topics if needed

### Issue: Forgot password email not sending
**Solution:**
1. Check SENDGRID_API_KEY is set
2. Check backend console logs
3. If testing without SendGrid, check console for reset link

### Issue: Docker containers not starting
**Solution:**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

### Issue: Database connection failed
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps
# Restart database
docker-compose restart db
```
