      title: 'Why Do Black Holes Slow Down Time?',
      categoryId: physics.id,
      estimatedReadTime: 2,
      contentSimple: 'Imagine you are near a super heavy ball in space. Time actually moves slower for you than for someone far away! Black holes are so heavy that they bend space and time around them. The closer you get, the slower your clock ticks compared to clocks far away. It is like time itself gets stretched! Scientists proved this is real using super precise clocks. If you fell into a black hole, people watching from far away would see you move slower and slower, like a video in slow motion.',
      contentMedium: 'Black holes demonstrate Einstein theory of general relativity in its most extreme form. Their immense gravitational field warps spacetime to such a degree that time dilation becomes significant. Near the event horizon, the point of no return, time passes much more slowly relative to observers at a safe distance. This is not science fiction - GPS satellites must account for time dilation effects to maintain accuracy. An observer falling toward a black hole would experience time normally, but to an outside observer, they would appear to freeze at the event horizon, their image redshifting into oblivion.',
      contentAdvanced: 'Gravitational time dilation near black holes emerges from the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein field equations. The metric reveals that proper time relates to coordinate time through a specific factor, approaching zero at the Schwarzschild radius. This creates an event horizon where time effectively stops from an external reference frame. The phenomenon has been experimentally verified through gravitational redshift measurements and is essential for understanding Hawking radiation, where virtual particle pairs near the horizon experience differential time flows, leading to black hole evaporation over cosmological timescales.',

      categoryId: mathematics.id,
      estimatedReadTime: 2,
      contentSimple: 'Compound interest is like a snowball rolling down a hill - it keeps getting bigger! When you save money, the bank pays you interest. With compound interest, you earn interest on your interest too. If you save 100 dollars and earn 10 percent interest, you get 10 dollars. Next year, you earn interest on 110 dollars, not just 100 dollars. Over many years, this makes your money grow much faster than simple interest. It is why starting to save early is so powerful!',
      contentMedium: 'Compound interest is calculated on the initial principal and accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula determines the future value, where P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounding frequency, and t is time in years. For example, 1000 dollars at 5 percent compounded annually becomes about 1629 dollars after 10 years, but about 1647 dollars if compounded monthly. This difference grows with time and rate. The Rule of 72 estimates doubling time by dividing 72 by the interest rate. Understanding compound interest is crucial for retirement planning and debt management.',
      contentAdvanced: 'Compound interest represents exponential growth described by continuous compounding when n approaches infinity. The effective annual rate allows comparison across different compounding frequencies. In financial mathematics, present value calculations use discounting formulas. The time value of money principle underlies derivatives pricing, bond valuation, and actuarial science. Compounding exponential nature explains both wealth accumulation and debt spirals, making it fundamental to portfolio theory and risk management strategies.',

Content that tells a story or shows something amazing spreads fastest. Companies try to create viral content by making things that people want to talk about with friends. The best viral content feels personal and relatable, not like an ad. Sometimes a simple idea shared at the right time can reach millions of people in just days!',
      contentMedium: 'Viral marketing leverages psychological triggers to achieve exponential organic reach. Research shows content goes viral when it triggers high-arousal emotions like awe, excitement, or anger. The STEPPS framework identifies six principles: Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public visibility, Practical Value, and Stories. Successful campaigns like Dollar Shave Club and Old Spice combined humor, unexpectedness, and shareability. Network effects amplify reach when each share generates multiple new shares, creating geometric growth.',
      contentAdvanced: 'Viral marketing exhibits characteristics of epidemiological models applied to information diffusion. The basic reproduction number must exceed one for viral propagation, influenced by network topology, homophily, and weak tie bridges. Emotional contagion theory explains how affect transfers through social networks. Neuroscientific studies reveal that highly shareable content activates specific brain regions associated with self-referential processing and social cognition. Algorithmic amplification in social media platforms creates power-law distributions in content reach, where virality depends on early momentum during the critical first hours post-publication.',
