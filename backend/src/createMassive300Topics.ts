      contentMedium: 'Fission involves splitting heavy nuclei like uranium, releasing energy according to E=mc¬≤. Fusion combines light nuclei like hydrogen isotopes, releasing more energy per reaction. Both processes convert mass to energy but face different technical challenges.',
      contentAdvanced: 'Nuclear fission exploits the binding energy curve\'s peak around iron-56, where heavy nuclei can release energy by splitting. Fusion releases energy by combining light nuclei, overcoming Coulomb repulsion through high temperatures or quantum tunneling.
